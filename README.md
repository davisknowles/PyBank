# PyBank

## Objective
- Create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company from [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv).
## Criteria
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
- As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```
- Final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text     file with the results.
